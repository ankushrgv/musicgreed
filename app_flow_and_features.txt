1. The hhome page shows the Track tab by default

2. Initially all the tabs will be empty.

3. Now to add a new TRACK, the following are required:
	a) The Artist of the track should exist in the database
	b) The Genre of the track should exist in the database
	c) The Album of the track should exist in the database

	The above checks are important so as to avoid entering of garbage data into the DB.

4. So now, first add a new ARTIST

	b) Fill in the name of the artist.
	c) New artist has been added which is automatically displayed in the ARTIST tab.

	Again, this check has been done to maintain the mapping of albums and artist and to
	avoid entering of garbage data.

7. Now that the Artist, Genre and Album of the track to be added have all been created,
	we can now add a new track.

8. Go to the TRACKS tab
	a) Click on the "add new track" button
	b) Fill in valid details of artist, genre and album else the track won't be created.
	c) If the details are correct, the track will be added and hence will be displayed 
		under the TRACK tab.

9. In the same way, to add any track, you need to check whether its artist, album and 
	genre already exist in the DB or not.

	on them respectively. This will open a DETAILVIEW of the same.

11. In the DETAILVIEW, one can edit the details by clicking on the "Edit Details" button

12. User can edit details and then submit the changes.

13. Again, chceks have been made so as to allow only valid entry to the DB.
